BRUSSELS —  Europe will not negotiate trade deals with a gun to the head, French leader Emmanuel Macron said on Friday, reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to grant the European Union a 40-day exemption on metal tariffs pending further talks."We will talk about anything as a principal with a friendly country that respects the rules of the World Trade Organization. We won't talk at all with a country if it is with a gun to our heads," Macron told a news conference after a meeting of EU leaders.Macron said the EU held no desire to engage in a trade war with the United States and said the bloc must be "united and determined" in its response."Europe cannot be the ... weakest  link," Macron said.(Reporting by Richard Lough; editing by Foo Yun Chee)
