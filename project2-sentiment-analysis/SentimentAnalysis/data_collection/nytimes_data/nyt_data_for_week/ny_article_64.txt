ROCKLIN, Calif. —  Students at a California high school are organizing an anti-abortion rights protest that was inspired by the recent nationwide student walkout for gun control.Rocklin High School student Brandon Gillespie tells KOVR-TV he wants to "honor all the lives of aborted babies" with the protest.He says the idea was prompted by history teacher Julianne Benzel. She was placed on administrative leave when she asked students to consider whether there was a double standard over protests on school grounds between gun control and abortion.Student newspaper editor Naeirika Neev says "abortions aren't really anything that has to do with school or students."Gillespie says he'll discuss the protest with the principal on Friday.
