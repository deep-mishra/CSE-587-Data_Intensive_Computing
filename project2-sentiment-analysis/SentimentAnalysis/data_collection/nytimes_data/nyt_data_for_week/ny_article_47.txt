They held signs like "The Second Amendment Needs Amending" and "Prayers are Not Enough."Sixteen-year-old Columbine student Kalli Honeycutt, says her mother, who survived that shooting, has drilled it into her head to always be on the lookout.Honeycutt said she is demonstrating because she wants lawmakers to make it harder for people to get guns and cause tragedies like school shootings.Survivors of last month's Florida school shooting have described themselves as the "mass-shooting generation," noting that they were born after the Columbine shooting.___5:50 p.m.High school students led thousands of protesters in Seattle on Saturday, part of a nation-wide youth movement demanding tighter gun regulation in the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead.Students held signs reading "Not One More" and chanted "Right now, right here, we refuse to live in fear." Teachers protested President Donald Trump's proposal to arm some of them in order to protect students from potential attackers.Much of the protest was directed at the National Rifle Association."I want to know that they care more about lives than profit, the NRA," said Naa'Rai Taison, a 19-year-old student at Cornish College of the Arts.

"It was students my own age who decided they wanted to put an end to gun violence."Across town outside the Montana Capitol, a smaller crowd of gun-rights advocates swore that no outsiders would dictate gun laws in Montana. One speaker, Montana State University student Joey Chester, drew boos when he referenced the other protest."If something went wrong there, the first people to show up are going to be people with guns," Chester said.The gun-control advocates gathered in Montana were among hundreds of thousands rallying nationwide at "March for Our Lives" events on Saturday. The events are intended to rally support for stricter gun control laws in the wake of school shootings.___4:10 p.m.Pro-gun activists held counter-protests at some cities across the western United States on Saturday, even as hundreds of thousands of people rallied at gun control events at the same time.In Salt Lake City, Utah about 500 pro-gun marchers walked to the state Capitol building, advocating for fortified schools and more armed teachers.

Their efforts have galvanized youth nationwide, with hundreds of thousands attending similar rallies across the country.Gonzalez wrapped up the Washington, D.C. rally with some homework for those who demonstrated nationwide:"One final plug," she said.

"I'm looking for tougher gun laws and legislation that includes banning semi-automatic and assault weapons."In Atlanta, Thorne held aloft a sign reading "Guns Don't Kill People. Ummm... Yes They Do," as he described how he and his classmates recently underwent active shooter drills in school.And Hmura called on the nearly 2,400 people gathered at the Salem rally to fight for change."There cannot be two sides to our safety in school where we should be learning, growing and making friends — not learning how to duck and cover," Hmura said.___3 p.m.U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said in a prepared statement Saturday that he supports demonstrators' rights to march at anti-gun rallies across the country, but called for activists to find common ground with opponents."While protests are a legitimate way of making a point, in our system of government, making a change requires finding common ground with those who hold opposing views," the Republican from Florida said.Rubio's district includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last month. He said that a ban on bump stocks (used to make guns fire more rapidly), improvements to the gun background check system and other efforts were achieved by finding common ground with those who don't want certain gun bans."And finding common ground is what it will take to pass our red flag law so we can take guns away from dangerous people," Rubio said.Hundreds of thousands of people in cities across the United States are attending "March for Our Lives" rallies, calling on lawmakers to enact legislation to help stop school shootings and reduce gun violence.___2:20 p.m.Thousands of people are flooding the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand stricter gun laws in the U.S.The rally was one of several being held across California and the United States on Saturday.Protesters held signs and chanted as they marched to Los Angeles City Hall for the "March for Our Lives" rally.Zoe Lopez, a 15-year-old high school freshman from Garden Grove, said she's attending the rally to demand additional regulations on gun purchases.In Sacramento, thousands chanted: "hey, hey, ho, ho, the NRA has got to go" as they assembled at the state's capitol.Rallies in Oakland and San Diego also drew hundreds of demonstrators.Similar rallies were being held in cities across America to march for gun control and ignite political activism among teenagers.___2:10 p.m.The granddaughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. told tens of thousands of "March for Our Lives" demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. that she too has a dream — for a gun-free world."I have a dream that enough is enough," Yolanda Renee King said, referencing her grandfather's famous speech.
