A Maryland high school student who fatally shot his ex-girlfriend and injured another student outside a classroom last week killed himself when a school resource officer stationed on campus confronted him, the authorities said on Monday evening.The shooting at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland last Tuesday was over in about a minute. Just before the first class period started, Austin Wyatt Rollins pulled out his father’s handgun in a hallway and fired one shot. It struck his former girlfriend, Jaelynn Willey, in the head and the other student, Desmond Barnes, in the leg. Moments later, Mr. Rollins, 17, was dead in another part of the school.But before Monday, it was not clear whether the gunman had killed himself or whether the resource officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, fatally shot him. The St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said its investigation had found that Mr. Rollins fired one shot at Jaelynn, 16, and then one more into his head at the same time Deputy Gaskill fired his weapon.Deputy Gaskill’s shot missed Mr. Rollins but struck his handgun, the sheriff’s office said. In its initial report after the shooting, the sheriff’s office said Deputy Gaskill and Mr. Rollins had exchanged gunfire.Amid the national debate over gun control and school shootings, Deputy Gaskill was heralded for his swift response and hailed as an example of how officers on campus can quickly end shootings. In the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., politicians including President Trump have called for arming teachers and placing additional officers on campuses. Some have criticized those ideas.After the Maryland shooting, Jaelynn was taken to University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center. Her parents said she was taken off life support on Thursday after she had been declared brain dead.
