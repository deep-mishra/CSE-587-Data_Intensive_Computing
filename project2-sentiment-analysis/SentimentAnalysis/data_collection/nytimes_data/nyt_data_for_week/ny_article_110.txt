PORTLAND, Maine —  A group of parents raffling off a gun to support a Maine high school graduation celebration is receiving backlash online.WGME-TV reports the group is raffling off a 9mm handgun that a parent donated to raise money for Project Graduation at Hodgdon High School. Sporting goods store owner and parent Michelle Crane promoted the raffle on her Facebook page last month.Crane says all laws apply in the raffle and that the winner must pass a background check. She says the group has raffled off guns before.Some Facebook users say the raffle is insensitive to the families of students killed in recent school shootings in Florida and Maryland.Principal Mary Harbison says she doesn't supervise Project Graduation so she won't weigh in on the issue.___Information from: WGME-TV, http://www.wgme.com
