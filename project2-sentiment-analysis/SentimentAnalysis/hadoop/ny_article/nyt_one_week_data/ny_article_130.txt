Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.‘ASSSSCAT 3000’ at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater Hell’s Kitchen (March 25, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.).

At the end, the audience is invited to participate in karaoke, too. 347-451-3873, qedastoria.com50 COMEDIANS TELL JOKES TO BENEFIT GUN CONTROL at Littlefield (March 28, 8 p.m.).
