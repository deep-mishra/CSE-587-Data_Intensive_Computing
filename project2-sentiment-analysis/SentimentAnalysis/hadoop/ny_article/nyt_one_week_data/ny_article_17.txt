More than 800 protests for stricter gun laws are planned for Saturday in the United States and in countries around the world, according to a website set up by the organizers.The demonstrations are part of a wave of activism since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed by a gunman with an assault rifle on Feb. 14.The main rally, organized by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas shooting, will take place in Washington along Pennsylvania Avenue. Additional demonstrations appear to be planned in every state of the union, more than 700 nationwide.A month after the Parkland shooting, on March 14, thousands of students across the United States participated in a national school walkout to protest gun violence.Organizers say they have also planned demonstrations on every continent except Antarctica, though most will take place in the United States and Europe. A previous global demonstration on this scale came in January 2017, when women’s marches on every continent drew protestors.
