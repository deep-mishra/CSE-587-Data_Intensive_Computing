As sequels to sci-fi action thrillers showcasing giant metallic fighters go, “Pacific Rim Uprising” is adroit and enjoyable. John Boyega, who’s also a regular in the new “Star Wars” pictures, stars as Jake Pentecost, the decidedly more roguish son of Idris Elba’s character from 2013’s “Pacific Rim.” He steals parts from scrapped Jaegers — the gigantic human-piloted machines that battled hordes of Kaiju (giant monsters, that is) in the first film. Early in the movie he meets a whiz-kid Jaeger bootlegger named Amara (Cailee Spaeny) and they both end up back in pilot school.With the world supposedly free from Kaiju threat, the movie spends its first hour toggling between “Top Gun”-style cadet rivalries and a corporate espionage plot that’s not unfamiliar, except that you almost never see it done well in this kind of movie. But you know that the scaly, slimy creatures are going to turn up eventually, and when they do, they spend a good amount of time in Tokyo.Some familiar faces return, including those of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as eccentric scientists — one of whose eccentricities have grown pronouncedly more extreme. Scott Eastwood is also on board, and he uses his uncanny resemblance to his father Clint to pleasing effect.Directed by the television veteran Steven S. DeKnight (“Angel,” “Smallville”), the movie balances amiable humor and standard believe-in-yourself bromides with better than average action sequences. I grew up on “Godzilla” movies and retain some vestigial fondness for them — and, incidentally, I can’t stand “Transformers” movies. That “Pacific Rim Uprising” managed to hit me in my “Godzilla” sweet spot is the best recommendation I can give it.
