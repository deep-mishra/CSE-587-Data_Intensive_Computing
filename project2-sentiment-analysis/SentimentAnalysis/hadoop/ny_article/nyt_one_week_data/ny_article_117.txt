COLUMBUS, Miss. —  The states of Georgia and Mississippi have open-carry laws, meaning licensed gun owners can go around in public displaying their weapons. But businesses still have the right to prohibit weapons on their property.That's what happened in a Mississippi Walmart on Monday night after three Georgia men went shopping while openly carrying an M-4 assault rifle, a handgun and a machete.The Commercial Dispatch reports that a Walmart employee called police and then managers asked the men to leave once officers arrived.Columbus Police Chief Fred Shelton says they left without incident.The Walmart store didn't have a sign saying weapons are prohibited, but the chief says that doesn't matter. He says anyone seeing someone carrying a weapon should call police and let officers determine if they pose a threat.___Information from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com
