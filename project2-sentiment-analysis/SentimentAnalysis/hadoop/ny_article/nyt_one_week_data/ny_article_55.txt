King took to Facebook to question the teenager's guns stance and her use of the communist-run island's flag.King says Gonzalez was claiming Cuban heritage while not speaking Spanish and advocating for gun control when her ancestors fled a dictatorship that disarmed people.Ros-Lehtinen says Gonzalez wore the patch because she is proud of her heritage, not because she supports Castro's dictatorship.The Parkland student thanked the congresswoman in a tweet .
