The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads:The Library of Congress writes, “The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.”What do you think the words of the Second Amendment mean? What relevance should they have for the national debate about gun laws?Then read these four excerpts from Opinion pieces published this month in The Times — or follow the links to read the complete Op-Ed — and decide: What do you think lawmakers should do about guns and gun violence?Excerpt 1: In “John Paul Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment,” John Paul Stevens, a retired associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, writes:_________Excerpt 2: In “After the March, Follow This Gun Reform Battle Plan,” Steve Israel, a Democratic representative from Long Island from 2001 to 2017, writes:He continues:_________Excerpt 3: In “Stop Shielding Gun Makers,” Brad S. Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and H. Christopher Boehning, a partner there, write:_________Excerpt 4: In “Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America,” Robert Leonard, the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS, writes:_________Students: After reading the four excerpts above, tell us:— Why does this topic interest you? How have your own experiences shaped your opinions? What questions or concerns does this topic raise for you?— Do you believe the government is currently striking the right balance between public safety and protecting people’s individual rights? Why or why not?— Would you rather the government err on the side of protecting an individual’s right to own a gun, or on the public’s health and safety? Or do you feel this is a false choice? Why?— After mass shootings or renewed fears that the government will ban gun ownership, many people go out to buy guns — perhaps to feel safer in times of insecurity. Americans now own more than 300 million guns. Do you think people buying more guns will prevent gun deaths?— How should we try to reduce the number of gun deaths and injuries in the United States? Do you think lawmakers should pursue any of the options discussed in the Opinion pieces above? If so, which ones, and why?— What other options or possible solutions exist, in your view, and why?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
