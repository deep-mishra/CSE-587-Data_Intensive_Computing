Since retiring from filmmaking in 2013 and unretiring last year, Steven Soderbergh sure has been busy. He directed the 2017 big-screen car-racing comedy “Logan Lucky” as well as a murder mystery, “Mosaic,” which was broadcast last week on HBO. Now the trailer for his latest movie, “Unsane,” has just been released.
Like “Mosaic,” which originated as an interactive app that allowed users to affect the plot, “Unsane” represents an experiment for the indie auteur. Shot entirely on an iPhone — Mr. Soderbergh has declared the device to be “the future” of filmmaking — the claustrophobic thriller follows a stalking victim (Claire Foy) who is committed to a mental institution against her will.
Ms. Foy has won a Golden Globe for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix drama “The Crown” but has yet to prove herself as a bankable lead in a feature film. She will follow “Unsane” with “The Girl in the Spider’s Web,” taking over the role of Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara in the Hollywood version of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”).
The “Unsane” supporting cast includes Amy Irving, who worked with Mr. Soderbergh on “Traffic” in 2000 but has rarely been seen in recent movies. Joshua Leonard, one of the original co-stars of “The Blair Witch Project,” brings his underground horror-movie cred to the role of the stalker.
“Unsane” hits theaters on March 23.
