The director Eli Roth made his name with adults-only horror films like “Hostel,” but he’s setting out to scare a younger audience with “The House With a Clock in its Walls,” which has just released its first trailer.
Adapted by Eric Kripke (TV’s “Supernatural”) from the young-adult novel by John Bellairs, the story follows an orphan, Lewis (Owen Vaccaro), who moves into the spooky titular abode with his uncle (Jack Black).
As if the unseen ticking timepiece weren’t creepy enough, the home also features such haunted-house standbys as suits of armor, jack-o’-lanterns and a tentacled monster that pops out of a closet. “That’s safe?” Lewis asks. His uncle reassures him, “As long as it’s fed.”
Mr. Black has enjoyed a lucrative run in family-oriented movies, from his 2003 breakout “School of Rock” to last year’s smash “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.” His co-star, Cate Blanchett (as a bespectacled neighbor), also has experience in the genre, having played the evil stepmother in Disney’s 2015 live-action remake of “Cinderella.”
Mr. Roth, whose recent reboot of “Death Wish” misfired at the box office, seems to have drawn visual inspiration from both Edward Gorey (who illustrated the 1973 book) and Steven Spielberg. The trailer opens with throwback logos for Universal Pictures and Mr. Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, homages to the filmmaker’s early classics like “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.”
“The House With a Clock in its Walls” arrives in theaters on Sept. 21.
