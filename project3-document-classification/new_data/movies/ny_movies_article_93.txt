In movies like “Pitch Perfect” and “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,” the actor Adam Devine plays a particular kind of hapless vulgar goofball, an amalgam of a couple of innocuous characters in the 1978 comedy “National Lampoon’s Animal House.” In the new movie “Game Over, Man!” (in which Mr. Devine stars with Anders Holm and Blake Anderson, his cast mates on the TV series “Workaholics”) the actor adds some of John Belushi’s anarchic slobbery from the 40-year-old landmark comedy. It doesn’t help the movie overall.
Alexxx, Mr. Devine’s character, is the idea man in a troika of service-industry losers who dream of video game entrepreneurship while enduring their work as housekeepers/waiters at a deluxe hotel. In an early scene, Alexxx and his pals negotiate a bedroom littered with used condoms. Upon learning that a blinged-out Bey (Utkarsh Ambudkar) is giving a party at the hotel, the crew is determined to pitch him their business idea. But there is villainy afoot. As one character in a group of black-clad folks disembarking from an S.U.V. says to their ringleader, “You didn’t bring me along because I look like the black nerd from ‘Die Hard,’ cause I don’t.” So there’s your premise, but instead of John McClane fighting the evildoers invading the building, you’ve got the bro variant of the Three Stooges.
This almost laugh-free comedy, a Netflix Original directed by Kyle Newacheck, is distinguished by a relentless level of outrageous yet strangely listless vulgarity. There are several penis jokes, including one requiring a high level of exposure on Mr. Devine’s part. Several characters die gorily, prompting other characters to make observations like “He is full-on spaghetti and meat sauce.” There is a “why am I watching this” analingus sight “gag.” The genuinely amusing comedian Joel McHale makes a cameo appearance in this mess. I hope that’s because he lost a bet.
