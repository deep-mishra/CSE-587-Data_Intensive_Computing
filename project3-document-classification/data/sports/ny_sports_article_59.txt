(Reuters) - The Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) and the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) have signed an agreement to share the organization of the World Beach Games after the 2019 edition.
The World Beach Games is a global gathering that will comprise 15 sports at the inaugural ANOC-organized competition taking place in San Diego next year.
The new deal will see the bodies form a 50-50 partnership to organize the Games through a jointly-held company in Switzerland for every two years after the first edition.
"We are delighted to have reached this agreement to work in partnership with ANOC to ensure a bright future for the World Beach Games," GAISF president Patrick Baumann said in a statement released by ANOC.
" ...The partnership will ensure that GAISF continues to fulfil its role of providing showcase events for our Member Federations, promoting new disciplines and bringing the expertise from all International Federations to the table."
The program for the Beach Games will be decided in agreement with the International Olympics Committee (IOC). In principle, no Olympic events are allowed to be included in future Beach Games.
Beach soccer, open water swimming, beach handball, beach tennis, wakeboarding and kiteboarding are among the sports involved in the event.
