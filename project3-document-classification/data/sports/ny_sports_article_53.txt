(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur must be ready for a Manchester City side that has been stung by three consecutive defeats, defender Ben Davies said ahead of Saturday's Premier League encounter.
City's 3-2 home league defeat by Manchester United was sandwiched between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool, which saw Pep Guardiola's side lose both to go out 5-1 on aggregate.
"I'm pretty sure they are going to be desperate for the win after the results they have had this week," Davies told Sky Sports News.
"It's been a sticky patch for them but they have been flawless this season. It is going to be a tough game, we are definitely expecting them to come all guns blazing and we've got to be ready for that."
Tottenham are unbeaten in the league since a 4-1 defeat by City at the Etihad in December.
City could wrap up the title if they beat Spurs and United lose at home to bottom-side West Bromwich Albion.
