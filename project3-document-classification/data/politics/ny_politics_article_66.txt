The editors in National Review:
The editorial board at National Review think that the news media (particularly on the left) has overreacted to a push to release a memo drafted by Republican staff members on the House Intelligence Committee, overseen by Representative Devin Nunes of California. They urge the F.B.I. and the Democrats to share their own sides of the story, writing, “This is called public debate, and we assure the Red hunters on the left that this is not how the Kremlin conducts its affairs.” Read more »

Noah Rothman in NBC THINK:
According to Mr. Rothman, conservatives are right to scrutinize the F.B.I.’s actions, but they have the wrong target in mind. Rather than focusing, as the Nunes memo does, on the law enforcement agency’s handling of the Trump campaign, conservatives should instead be calling for accountability on investigations into Hillary Clinton’s behavior.

Greg Sargent in The Washington Post:
Any Republican who does not publicly opposing the release of the Nunes memo, Mr. Sargent contends, is actively aiding the president in politicizing law enforcement. Read more »

Jonathan Chait in New York Magazine:
Mr. Chait points to the hypocrisy of Republicans who claim that the aim of the Nunes memo is to expose an abuse of the civil liberties of Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign.

Those pushing for the memo’s release argue that because the Justice Department used the dossier compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, and never told the court that the document was funded by Democrats, the whole investigation into the Trump’s campaign collusion with Russia was tainted from the start. Mr. Kerr, a libertarian-leaning lawyer, has considerable experience in these questions. He explains how federal judges have faced similar claims in litigation, they have mostly rejected them out of hand.” Read more »

Noah Feldman in Bloomberg: 
Mr. Feldman argues that Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, is not merely protecting his agency’s reputation when he urged the White House not to release the Nunes memo. Instead, his actions convince Mr. Feldman that he is “fighting back on behalf of the unwritten norm against injecting politics into investigations.” Read more »

Jonathan Turley in The Hill: 
Mr. Turley, a law professor and constitutional scholar at George Washington University, explains how the whole memo episode may strengthen a rule that has “until now, only been discussed in the abstract by fringe elements in politics and the law.” Subsection 11(g) of Rule X empowers intelligence committees to exercise oversight over intelligence agencies known for overclassifying documents that may be embarrassing or damaging to the agency’s reputation.
