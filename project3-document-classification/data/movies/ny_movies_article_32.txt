In “Wildling,” Anna (played at high school age by Bel Powley), can be excused for not recognizing that her life is a checklist of horror movie tropes. After all, she was raised in captivity by a man she calls Daddy (Brad Dourif), who kept her confined and incurious with an elaborate set of myths and rules. He even gave her injections to stunt her puberty.
But those same genre tropes dictate that Anna will eventually leave her isolated cabin and meet other human beings, and perhaps even be temporarily, unconvincingly placed in the custody of a surrogate mother — in this case, a small-town sheriff named Ellen (Liv Tyler).
Still, something strange is happening. Anna’s surprising strength, her speed at chasing wildlife, her habit of eating only the meat part of burgers — all signal that she is far from a textbook abuse case. And like Anna’s choice in meals, this creature feature from the director Fritz Böhm is functional but lacks flavor, an imaginative spark that might distinguish it from any number of other I-was-a-teenage-monster movies.
Ms. Powley, continuing a track record of being better than her roles, is well suited to her character’s wide-eyed wonderment. Anna’s first outdoor encounter with sunlight, her interactions with high school classmates and her budding romantic interest in Ellen’s younger brother (Collin Kelly-Sordelet) make up the best scenes in the movie, which suffers as much as she does when she turns into a special effect.
