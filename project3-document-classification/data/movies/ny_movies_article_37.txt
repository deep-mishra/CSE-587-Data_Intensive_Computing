LONDON — The empire really will strike back, with British royalty set to be part of the coming “Star Wars” film. Prince William and Prince Harry will make cameos in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” (due Dec. 15), the film’s lead actor John Boyega has told The Hollywood Reporter.
At a taping of The Hollywood Reporter’s Actors Roundtable show, Mr. Boyega, who plays Finn in the movie, confirmed that the royal brothers will play Stormtroopers in a scene alongside him. The actor Tom Hardy and the singer Gary Barlow of Take That will also appear in the scene.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Prince William and Prince Harry, along will Mr. Hardy and Mr. Barlow, will guard Mr. Boyega’s character in an elevator scene. It is not yet known whether any of them will have a speaking role.
Speculation that the royal pair would be making an appearance in the highly anticipated movie has mounted since April 2016 when they were photographed on the set dueling with lightsabers.
The royals reportedly filmed the scene when they visited the set of the sci-fi series at the Pinewood studios here in April 2016. At the time of the visit, The Guardian reported that Kensington Palace said it was to celebrate the creative British talent that went into the movies.
While this may be the first time a royal will have a cameo in a “Star Wars” movie, there is a precedent of celebrities covertly playing Stormtroopers. In 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” the first of the current “Star Wars” trilogy, Daniel Craig played one in a scene with Daisy Ridley’s Rey character.
On Nov. 9, the Walt Disney Company announced a new Star Wars trilogy that will expand beyond the current Skywalker saga, overseen by Rian Johnson, director of “The Last Jedi.”
“The Last Jedi” is the second installment in the current trilogy since the Walt Disney Company bought the Lucasfilm production company from George Lucas, its founder and the creator of the “Star Wars” series, for $4.05 billion in 2012.
