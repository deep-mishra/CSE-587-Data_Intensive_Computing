The 1971 hit “I’d Love to Change the World” by Ten Years After plays under the new trailer for “7 Days in Entebbe.” But as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages on more than 40 years after the events depicted in the film, it seems the world hasn’t changed much.
On June 27, 1976, hijackers commandeered an Air France flight from Israel to Paris and ultimately forced the plane with more than 200 aboard to land at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. The militants threatened to kill passengers unless Palestinian and other prisoners held in Israel and elsewhere were released. One week later, on the same day the United States celebrated its bicentennial, Israeli forces executed a mission rescuing most of the hostages. Among those killed were all of the hijackers as well as three hostages and one Israeli soldier, Jonathan “Yoni” Netanyahu, the older brother of Israel’s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Daniel Brühl and Rosamund Pike play members of a radical West German group who carried out the hijacking along with Palestinian revolutionaries. The cast also includes Eddie Marsan as Shimon Peres, Israel’s defense minister at the time and later its president and prime minister.
Two quickly made TV movies with all-star casts, “Raid on Entebbe” and “Victory at Entebbe,” were broadcast several months after the events. “7 Days in Entebbe,” written by Gregory Burke (“’71”) and directed by José Padilha (“Narcos”), promises to take a more nuanced look at the story and will be released in theaters domestically on March 16.
