After serving six bloody seasons on “The Walking Dead,” the actor Steven Yeun could be forgiven for seeking a cleaner, quieter life. Yet here he is in “Mayhem,” still happily slaying zombielike antagonists and up to his armpits in gore.
He isn’t the only one seeking comfort in the familiar. Jumping on the rage-virus bandwagon popularized by the “[REC]” franchise, among others, Matias Caruso’s script unfolds in a gleaming, high-rise law firm where Derek (Mr. Yeun) is being unjustly fired for his boss’s error. At the same time, we learn that the building is under quarantine because of an inhibition-erasing infection that turns eyeballs red and regular people into sex- and violence-crazed lunatics.
As Derek and a disgruntled client (a gung-ho Samara Weaving) fall prey to the virus and join forces to wipe out the firm’s slimy C.E.O. — and anyone who tries to stop them — the director, Joe Lynch, concocts an uneven blend of video game setups and corporate satire. Given that speed and splatter are typically paramount in movies like this, the decision to slow the slaughter every so often to navigate workplace politics feels ill-advised — especially when Derek’s nail gun and selection of lethal office supplies are a long way from exhausted.
Coolly photographed by Steve Gainer, “Mayhem” embraces its pulpy title with fighting-and-fornicating glee. Neither innovative nor particularly clever, the movie understands its mission and benefits from Mr. Yeun’s unfailing air of basic decency. Derek might literally be slicing-and-dicing his way to the top, but no one who listens to Dave Matthews Band could truly be evil. Could they?
