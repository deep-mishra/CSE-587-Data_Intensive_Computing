Even at a time of year when movie companies typically unload their dross, the sheer awfulness of Dito Montiel’s “The Clapper” stands out. Adapting his second book (“Eddie Krumble Is the Clapper”), Mr. Montiel — a former punk musician whose memoir, “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,” was filmed in 2006 — fails completely to transform sad-sack characters into interesting ones.
Instead, he presents them as borderline dolts, barely functioning adults defined by behavioral quirks and psychological soft spots. Eddie (Ed Helms) and his buddy Chris (an unusually restrained, possibly mortified Tracy Morgan) are bottom-feeding actors in Hollywood whose specialty is playing audience members on low-budget television shows. Clapping and hollering on cue — and sometimes, if they’re lucky, asking a prearranged question — they survive with minimal income and even less ambition.
Theirs is a livelihood that depends on blending into the crowd. So when Eddie’s ubiquity is spotted and exposed by a late-night television host (Russell Peters), he becomes a running joke and essentially unemployable. The notoriety also threatens to derail his painfully dimwitted pursuit of Judy (Amanda Seyfried), a sweetly simple gas-station cashier with a fondness for weird humans and wounded animals.
Mashing limp romance and artless satire into a ludicrously contrived plot, “The Clapper” lurches from one mirthlessly eccentric scene to another.
“Sometimes at night it feels like all the normal people just disappear,” Judy says, wistfully. Sometimes in movies it feels exactly the same way.
