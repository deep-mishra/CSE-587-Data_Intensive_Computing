A best actor win stemming from one of the worst American movies: At the Golden Globes, anything is possible.
James Franco picked up a Globe for his performance in “The Disaster Artist,” playing Tommy Wiseau, the director of the very bad, very cult film “The Room.” But it was Mr. Wiseau who stole the show. Mr. Franco invited the director, making his first appearance at the Globes, up to the stage with him. Mr. Wiseau went in for a hug, then went straight for the mic, but he was quickly pushed aside by the actor. Twitter had as much of a blast with the moment as Mr. Wiseau did.
Mr. Franco told a story about Mr. Wiseau being stuck in Golden Globes-related traffic 19 years ago. Then using the director’s one-of-a-kind accent (which Mr. Wiseau has said is Cajun but that most would call Eastern European), Mr. Franco read out a quote from Mr. Wiseau: “Golden Globes, so what, I’m not invited. I know they don’t want me, guy with accent, long hair. So I show them. I don’t wait for Hollywood, I make my own movie!”
That movie finally got him to those elusive Globes, perhaps not in the way he intended.
The New York Times critic Wesley Morris, commenting on the speech, wrote, “We’re learning that, for white men, the theme of night might be #ThemToo.”
